# ML Internship Projects

## Overview
Hello, I'm Sakshi Pawar! This repository contains the projects I completed during my 1-month virtual internship at Bharat Intern. I worked on two exciting projects: Iris Flower Classification and a Movies Recommendation System.

### Projects
1. **Iris Flower Classification:**
   - Implemented three different models:
      - Logistic Regression
      - Decision Tree Classifier
      - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Achieved impressive accuracies:
      - Logistic Regression: 100%
      - Decision Tree Classifier: 96.66%
      - Support Vector Machine: 100%
   - Utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

2. **Movies Recommendation System:**
   - Used various Python libraries:
      - Pandas
      - NumPy
      - Ast module
      - Scikit-learn for text vectorization using Bag of Words
      - NLTK library for stemming
   - Implemented cosine similarity measure for movie recommendations.
   - The system suggests 5 movies based on user preferences.
